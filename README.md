## 2-partition
### 9. Goldbach Conjecture
Every even number $\geq{6}$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers.
<p/>
<strong>Comment</strong>
<br/>
The closest result is from Jingrun Chen (1973), he proved that every sufficiently large even number can be written as the sum of either two primes, or a prime and a semiprime (the product of two primes). 
<br/>
This concerns the 2-partition of the set even integers, it might be related to the n-partition (Gumbel) distribution.
